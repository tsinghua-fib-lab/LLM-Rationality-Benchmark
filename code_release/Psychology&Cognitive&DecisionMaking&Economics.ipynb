It seems to be a poetic expression of missing someone, suggesting that a single day without seeing them feels as long as a significant period (March). However, it does not clearly indicate whether this perception is considered too long or too short compared to the actual time, which is necessary to determine if it's a distortion of time perception. Options B, C, and D all describe scenarios where time feels either too long or too short compared to the actual time, which fits the definition of time perception distortion.\n",

      "Explanation:\n",
      "A) Xiao Zhang is a beauty expert who personally uses cosmetics and recommends them to his relatives and friends through his WeChat Moments. This is a classic example of word-of-mouth marketing, as it involves a consumer sharing their positive experiences with a product within their personal network.\n",
      "\n",
      "C) Aunt Li shares her experience with a physical therapy device in her circle of friends, which is also a form of word-of-mouth marketing. Her posts have received a lot of attention (thousands of likes), indicating that her recommendations are being seen and potentially acted upon by others in her network.\n",
      "\n",
      "B) The Municipal Tourism Bureau's use of a cultural communication company to create an advertisement is a form of advertising, not word-of-mouth marketing. While the advertisement may generate buzz and lead to word-of-mouth, the act of creating and disseminating the advertisement itself is not word-of-mouth marketing.\n",
      "\n",
      "D) The shopping mall's release of promotional information on TV and distribution of flyers by retirees is a direct marketing effort. The long line of employees and their families at the mall is a result of the promotion, but it does not indicate that they are sharing their experiences or recommendations with others, which is a key component of word-of-mouth marketing.\n",

      "B Korva's population grew by a smaller percentage than did the population of at least one of the other two autonomous regions.\n",
      "-----------task-20-------------\n",
      "Answer: C A, B, have participated\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation:\n",
      "Let's analyze the given conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) If A participates, then B will also participate.\n",
      "(2) If C does not participate, then D will participate.\n",
      "(3) If A does not participate and C participates, then Captain E will participate.\n",
      "(4) Captain E and Deputy Captain B cannot both participate.\n",
      "(5) The superior decides that the deputy captain will participate.\n",
      "\n",
      "From condition (5), we know that the deputy captain will participate. Since B is the deputy captain, B must participate.\n",
      "\n",
      "From condition (1), since B is participating, A must also participate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's check the options against the conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "A) A, D, have participated - This could be true, but we don't have enough information about C and D's participation based on A's participation alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "B) C, D, have participated - This cannot be true because if C is participating, then condition (2) tells us that D would not necessarily participate.\n",
      "\n",
      "C) A, B, have participated - This is true because A's participation necessitates B's participation, and there is no information that contradicts this combination.\n",
      "\n",
      "D) A, B, D have participated - This could be true, but we don't have enough information about D's participation. D's participation is only mentioned in condition (2) if C does not participate, which is not discussed in this option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the only option that is completely correct based on the given conditions is C) A, B, have participated.\n",
      "-----------task-21-------------\n",

      "Explanation: According to the statements, Insider A suggests the boy may be from Sichuan or Guizhou, Insider B says he can't be from Sichuan, Insider C is sure he's from Sichuan, and Insider D says he's not from Guizhou. If we assume that only one person's story cannot be trusted, it must be Insider B, because Insider C's certainty conflicts with Insider B's denial. If Insider B's statement is false, it means the boy can be from Sichuan. Since Insider D also says the boy is not from Guizhou, and Insider A's statement does not conflict with Insider C's or D's, the only consistent conclusion is that the boy is from Sichuan.\n",

      "Answer: B H serves as a member of the three sub-committees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explanation: Since the question states that one of the six members serves as a member of three subcommittees, and there is no information provided that would exclude H from being that member, it is possible that H could serve on all three subcommittees. Options A and C are not necessarily true based on the information given, and option D is incomplete and does not provide enough information to determine its validity. Therefore, the most likely correct answer from the given options is B.\n",

      "A) A, D, have participated - This could be true, but we don't have enough information about C and D's participation based on A's participation alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "B) C, D, have participated - This cannot be true because if C is participating, then condition (2) tells us that D would not necessarily participate.\n",

If we assume that only one person's story cannot be trusted, it must be Insider B, because Insider C's certainty conflicts with Insider B's denial. If Insider B's statement is false, it means the boy can be from Sichuan. Since Insider D also says the boy is not from Guizhou, and Insider A's statement does not conflict with Insider C's or D's, the only consistent conclusion is that the boy is from Sichuan.\n",

      "If we test 20 new casks and we know that substance B is absent in all of them, we can expect a similar ratio of casks with substance C present as observed in the original data.

Following that, since substance A causes the production of substance C, it is also likely that substance C will be produced in all of the casks where substance A is present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, if substance B is manually added to all 20 new casks, it is expected that all 20 casks will contain substance C on average, assuming the causal relationships are consistent and there are no other factors inhibiting the production of substances A and C.\n",

      "Therefore, in the new casks where substance B has been manually removed, we would expect none of the casks to contain substance C on average, assuming that there are no other sources or mechanisms for the production of substance A and C.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is: 0 casks will contain substance C on average.\n",
      "-----------------\n",

      "- Substance B likely causes the production of substance A.\n",
      "- Substance A likely causes the production of substance C.\n",

      "Now, if we test 20 new casks and we know that substance B is present in all of them, we can expect that substance B will likely cause the production of substance A in these casks. Since substance A likely causes the production of substance C, we can expect that substance C will also be present in most, if not all, of these casks.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is one exception in the original data (cask 9) where substance A was present without substance C. This suggests that the correlation is not perfect, and there may be cases where substance A does not lead to the production of substance C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the strong correlation observed, we can estimate that a high number of the 20 new casks will contain substance C. To provide a conservative estimate while accounting for the possibility of exceptions like in cask 9, we might expect at least 19 out of 20 casks to contain substance C, on average. This is because in the original data, only one cask with substance A did not have substance C, suggesting a 95% likelihood (19 out of 20 cases) when substance A is present.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is 19.\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "Based on the information provided, if substance B is absent, it is unlikely that substance A will be produced since substance B likely causes the production of substance A. Furthermore, if substance A is not present, it is unlikely that substance C will be produced because substance A likely causes the production of substance C.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the observations of the previous casks, we can see that whenever substance B is absent, substance C is also absent, except for Cask 20. Cask 20 is an anomaly where substance C is present despite the absence of substance B (and therefore presumably substance A). This could be due to an error, an exception, or an unknown factor that wasn't controlled for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that there is only one instance out of several where substance C is present without substance B, we can infer that it is a rare occurrence. Therefore, if we test 20 new casks in which we know substance B is absent, we can expect that substance C will also be absent in the vast majority of these casks, if not all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since we are looking for an average and considering the anomaly, we might expect a very low number of casks to contain substance C, potentially even zero. However, to account for the possibility of an anomaly like in Cask 20, we might predict a small number greater than zero but still very close to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the data, a reasonable estimate might be 1 or 0, but since we are looking for an average and anomalies are by definition rare, I would lean towards 0. Therefore, on average, we would expect 0 out of the 20 new casks to contain substance C if substance B is absent.\n"

A lab assistant gives tasters one of the cups, while the researcher watches their facial expressions. Based on this information, please assess whether this statement is true or false: The lab assistant should not watch the cups being filled.\n",
    "2. A researcher finds that American states with larger parks have fewer endangered species. Based on this information, please assess whether this statement is true or false: These data show that increasing the size of American state parks will reduce the number of endangered species.\n",
    "3. A researcher has subjects put together a jigsaw puzzle either in a cold room with a loud radio or in a warm room with no radio. Subjects solve the puzzle more quickly in the warm room with no radio. Based on this information, please assess whether this statement is true or false: The scientist cannot tell if the radio caused subjects to solve the puzzle more slowly.\n",
    "4. An education researcher wants to measure the general math ability of a sample of high-performing math students. All the students have taken classes in geometry and pre-calculus. Based on this information, please assess whether this statement is true or false: The education researcher can measure general math ability by giving the students a geometry test.\n",
    "5. Two scientists test an anti-acne cream on teenagers with acne. Scientist A wants to give the cream to all the teenagers in the study. Scientist B wants to give the cream to half the teenagers and give a cream without anti-acne ingredients to the other half. Based on this information, please assess whether this statement is true or false: Both ways of testing the cream are equally good.\n",
    "6. A researcher has a group of subjects play a competitive game. Each subject’s goal is to make money by buying and selling tokens. Subjects are paid a flat fee for participating in the experiment. Based on this information, please assess whether this statement is true or false: The researcher can confidently state that the behavior in the experiment reflects real-life buying and selling behavior.\n",
    "7. A randomly selected sample of Americans is surveyed about disease A before and after a 6-month media campaign about the disease. Mid-way through the media campaign, a famous celebrity dies of Disease A. The survey data indicate that knowledge of Disease A is higher after the campaign. Based on this information, please assess whether this statement is true or false: The media campaign may not have increased knowledge of Disease A.\n",
    "8. Subjects in an experiment must press a button whenever a blue dot flashes on their computer screen. At first, the task is easy for subjects. But as they continue to perform the task, they make more and more errors. Based on this information, please assess whether this statement is true or false: The blue dot must flash more quickly as the task progresses.\n",
    "9. Researchers want to see whether a health intervention helps school children to lose weight. School children are sorted into either an intervention or control group. Based on this information, please assess whether this statement is true or false: The researchers should assign the overweight children to the intervention group.\n",
    "10. A researcher develops a new method for measuring the surface tension of liquids. This method is more consistent than the old method. Based on this information, please assess whether this statement is true or false: The new method must also be more accurate than the old method.\n",
    "11. Two researchers are developing a survey to measure consumers’ feelings about customer service. Researcher A wants customers to rate their agreement with the statement “I am satisfied with customer service” on a 5-point scale. Researcher B wants customers to rate customer service on a 5-point scale, where 1 = not dissatisfied at all and 5 = highly dissatisfied.  Based on this information, please assess whether this statement is true or false: These questions are equally good for measuring how consumers feel about customer service.\n",

    "1. Some people show a tendency to judge a harmful action as worse than an equally harmful inaction. For example, this tendency leads to thinking it is worse to falsely testify in court that someone is guilty, than not to testify that someone is innocent.\n",
    "2. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a tendency to do or believe a thing only because many other people believe or do that thing, to feel safer or to avoid conflict.\n",
    "3. Many psychological studies have shown that people react to counterevidence by actually strengthening their beliefs. For example, when exposed to negative evidence about their favorite political candidate, people tend to implicitly counterargue against that evidence, therefore strengthening their favorable feelings toward the candidate.\n",
    "4. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a “disconfirmation” tendency in the way they evaluate research about potentially dangerous habits. That is, they are more critical and skeptical in evaluating evidence that an activity is dangerous when they engage in that activity than when they do not.\n",
    "5. Psychologists have identified an effect called “diffusion of responsibility,” where people tend not to help in an emergency situation when other people are present. This happens because as the number of bystanders increases, a bystander who sees other people standing around is less likely to interpret the incident as a problem, and also is less likely to feel individually responsible for taking action.\n",
    "6. Research has found that people will make irrational decisions to justify actions they have already taken. For example, when two people engage in a bidding war for an object, they can end up paying much more than the object is worth to justify the initial expenses associated with bidding.\n",
    "7. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a tendency to make “overly dispositional inferences” in the way they view victims of assault crimes. That is, they are overly inclined to view the victim’s plight as one he or she brought on by carelessness, foolishness, misbehavior, or naivetë.\n",
    "8. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a “halo” effect in the way they form impressions of attractive people. For instance, when it comes to assessing how nice, interesting, or able someone is, people tend to judge an attractive person more positively than he or she deserves.\n",
    "9. Extensive psychological research has shown that people possess an unconscious, automatic tendency to be less generous to people of a different race than to people of their race. This tendency has been shown to affect the behavior of everyone from doctors to taxi drivers.\n",
    "10. Psychologists have identified a tendency called the “ostrich effect,” an aversion to learning about potential losses. For example, people may try to avoid bad news by ignoring it. The name comes from the common (but false) legend that ostriches bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger.\n",
    "11. Many psychological studies have found that people have the tendency to underestimate the impact or the strength of another person’s feelings. For example, people who have not been victims of discrimination do not really understand a victim’s social suffering and the emotional effects of discrimination.\n",
    "12. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a “self-interest” effect in the way they view political candidates. That is, people’s assessments of qualifications, and their judgments about the extent to which particular candidates would pursue policies good for the American people as a whole, are influenced by their feelings about whether the candidates’ policies would serve their own particular interests.\n",
    "13. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a “self-serving” tendency in the way they view their academic or job performance. That is, they tend to take credit for success but deny responsibility for failure. They see their successes as the result of personal qualities, like drive or ability, but their failures as the result of external factors, like unreasonable work requirements or inadequate instructions.\n",
    "14. Psychologists have argued that gender biases lead people to associate men with technology and women with housework.\n",

I actively work to correct such thoughts when I recognize them.\n",

I try to be mindful of these tendencies and actively work against them, but I cannot claim to be completely free from the influence of widespread societal biases.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "4 - I believe I exhibit this bias to some extent. There are times when I might avoid looking at information that could indicate a loss or negative outcome, perhaps due to a desire to maintain a positive mood or avoid stress. However, I also recognize the importance of facing potential issues and try to balance this tendency by actively seeking out information when it's necessary to make informed decisions.\n",

      "4 - I try to be empathetic and understand others' feelings, but I recognize that sometimes I may not fully grasp the depth of someone else's experience, especially if it's outside my own. I believe I'm somewhat aware of this bias and make efforts to listen and learn from others' experiences to mitigate it.\n",
      "-------------------------\n",
      "5 - I believe that to some extent, my assessments of political candidates are influenced by how their policies might benefit my own interests. While I try to consider the greater good and the impact on the American people as a whole, it's challenging to completely separate personal interests from my judgments.\n",

    "1. Some people show a tendency to judge a harmful action as worse than an equally harmful inaction. For example, this tendency leads to thinking it is worse to falsely testify in court that someone is guilty, than not to testify that someone is innocent.\n",
    "2. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a tendency to do or believe a thing only because many other people believe or do that thing, to feel safer or to avoid conflict.\n",
    "3. Many psychological studies have shown that people react to counterevidence by actually strengthening their beliefs. For example, when exposed to negative evidence about their favorite political candidate, people tend to implicitly counterargue against that evidence, therefore strengthening their favorable feelings toward the candidate.\n",
    "4. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a “disconfirmation” tendency in the way they evaluate research about potentially dangerous habits. That is, they are more critical and skeptical in evaluating evidence that an activity is dangerous when they engage in that activity than when they do not.\n",
    "5. Psychologists have identified an effect called “diffusion of responsibility,” where people tend not to help in an emergency situation when other people are present. This happens because as the number of bystanders increases, a bystander who sees other people standing around is less likely to interpret the incident as a problem, and also is less likely to feel individually responsible for taking action.\n",
    "6. Research has found that people will make irrational decisions to justify actions they have already taken. For example, when two people engage in a bidding war for an object, they can end up paying much more than the object is worth to justify the initial expenses associated with bidding.\n",
    "7. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a tendency to make “overly dispositional inferences” in the way they view victims of assault crimes. That is, they are overly inclined to view the victim’s plight as one he or she brought on by carelessness, foolishness, misbehavior, or naivetë.\n",
    "8. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a “halo” effect in the way they form impressions of attractive people. For instance, when it comes to assessing how nice, interesting, or able someone is, people tend to judge an attractive person more positively than he or she deserves.\n",
    "9. Extensive psychological research has shown that people possess an unconscious, automatic tendency to be less generous to people of a different race than to people of their race. This tendency has been shown to affect the behavior of everyone from doctors to taxi drivers.\n",
    "10. Psychologists have identified a tendency called the “ostrich effect,” an aversion to learning about potential losses. For example, people may try to avoid bad news by ignoring it. The name comes from the common (but false) legend that ostriches bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger.\n",
    "11. Many psychological studies have found that people have the tendency to underestimate the impact or the strength of another person’s feelings. For example, people who have not been victims of discrimination do not really understand a victim’s social suffering and the emotional effects of discrimination.\n",
    "12. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a “self-interest” effect in the way they view political candidates. That is, people’s assessments of qualifications, and their judgments about the extent to which particular candidates would pursue policies good for the American people as a whole, are influenced by their feelings about whether the candidates’ policies would serve their own particular interests.\n",
    "13. Psychologists have claimed that some people show a “self-serving” tendency in the way they view their academic or job performance. That is, they tend to take credit for success but deny responsibility for failure. They see their successes as the result of personal qualities, like drive or ability, but their failures as the result of external factors, like unreasonable work requirements or inadequate instructions.\n",
    "14. Psychologists have argued that gender biases lead people to associate men with technology and women with housework.\n",

It's common for people to be more critical of information that contradicts their own behaviors or beliefs, especially when it comes to habits they might enjoy or be addicted to. This cognitive dissonance can lead to a strong disconfirmation bias as a way to justify their actions and avoid the discomfort of acknowledging the potential dangers of their habits.\n",

The Caldwells had long ago decided that when it was time to replace their car they would get what they called \"one of those solid, safety-conscious, built-to-last Swedish\" cars -- either a Volvo or a Saab. When the time to buy came, the Caldwells found that both Volvos and Saabs were expensive, but they decided to stick with their decision and to do some research on whether to buy a Volvo or a Saab. They got a copy of Consumer Reports and there they found that the consensus of the experts was that both cars were very sound mechanically, although the Volvo was felt to be slightly superior on some dimensions. They also found that the readers of Consumer Reports who owned a Volvo reported having somewhat fewer mechanical problems than owners of Saabs. They were about to go and strike a bargain with the Volvo dealer when Mr. Caldwell remembered that they had two friends who owned a Saab and one who owned a Volvo. Mr. Caldwell called up the friends. Both Saab owners reported having had a few mechanical problems but nothing major. The Volvo owner exploded when asked how he liked his car. \"First that fancy fuel injection computer thing went out: $400 bucks. Next I started having trouble with the rear end. Had to replace it. Then the transmission and the brakes. I finally sold it after 3 years at a big loss.” What do you think the Caldwells should do?\n",

    "1. Suppose you invest in company A’s stock and over the next 12 months the stock price appreciates by 10 percent. You contemplate selling stock A for normal portfolio rebalancing purpose, but then come across positive news about the company in the economic daily. It is mentioned that the stock price has a chance to increase further in the near future. \n",

    "2. Suppose you have decided to invest 1 million TWD in the stock market. You have narrowed your choices down to two companies: one Big Company, Inc, and one Small Company, Inc. According to your calculations, the two companies have equal risk and return characteristics. Big company is a well-followed, eminently established company, whose investors include many large pension funds. Small company has only a few well-known investors. What answer most closely matches your action in this situation? \n",
    "a. I will mostly likely invest in Big Company because I feel safe taking the same course as so many well-known institutional investors. If Big Company does decline in value, I could hardly blame myself for the wrong decision. \n",

      "The reason I would choose this option is that baseball is a sport with a long season, and player performance tends to even out over time. A high batting average over a small number of at-bats can be influenced by many factors, including luck. Over the course of a season, as players accumulate more at-bats, their true skill level becomes more apparent, and their statistics tend to approach their career norms. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"regression to the mean.\" While factors such as pitchers adjusting to batters, batters facing stress, and strategic pitching certainly play roles, the primary reason for the early-season anomaly is likely the small sample size and the variance that comes with it.\n"

The marbles are spread in a single layer on each tray. You must draw out one marble (without peeking, of course) from either tray. If you draw a black marble, you win $2. Consider a condition in which the small tray contains 1 black marble and 9 white marbles, and the large tray contains 8 black marbles and 92 white marbles.
