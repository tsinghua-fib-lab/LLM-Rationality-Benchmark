# LLM-Rationality-Benchmark

# ./SM_measurement_questions.docx
The measured questions in the benchmark, including all the scales and tests in **psychology**, **cognitive science**, **decision-making**, **economics**, and **societal** domains, and prompts for **game theory** and **cooperation and coordination** domains.  
(These questions are also included in the code file.)
